# Insight Data Engineering Code Challenge
-Execute by running the script run.sh

-Code challenge feature 1 is handled by process_tweets.py and feature 2 is handled by average_degree.py. Both files were coded and tested in Python 3.4.3 and utilize tweets2.txt. Note that average_degree.py reads tweets2.txt and run independently from process_tweets.py. It does not read from ft1.txt!
